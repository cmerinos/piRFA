Description: Provides functions to analyze differential item functioning (DIF) using
    the Restricted Factor Analysis (RFA) approach, implemented within a Multiple Indicators
    Multiple Causes (MIMIC) framework. The piRFA function includes likelihood ratio tests
    for global, uniform, and non-uniform DIF detection, as well as effect size estimation
    through a fixed-to-zero parameter release strategy. The implementation follows the
    conceptual work of Kolbe and Jorgensen, and utilizes functions from the 'lavaan' and
    'scripty' packages, among others.
